/*Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

        You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.*/

import java.util.Set;

/*Example 1:

        Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
        Output: 4
        Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

        Example 2:

        Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
        Output: 9*/

        Insert all array elements to hash.

        Check if this element is the starting point of a subsequence.To check this, simply look for arr[i] â€“1 in the
        hash,if not found, then this is the first element of a subsequence.
                If this element is the first element, then count the number of elements in the consecutive starting with
