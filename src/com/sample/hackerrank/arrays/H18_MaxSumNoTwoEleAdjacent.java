//Maximum sum such that no two elements are adjacent (Stickler Thief)

/*Input: arr[] = {5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5}
        Output: 110
        Explanation: Pick the subsequence {5, 100, 5}.
        The sum is 110 and no two elements are adjacent. This is the highest possible sum.

        Input: arr[] = {3, 2, 7, 10}
        Output: 13
        Explanation: The subsequence is {3, 10}. This gives sum = 13.
        This is the highest possible sum of a subsequence following the given criteria*/
